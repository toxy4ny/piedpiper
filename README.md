A precision-focused OSINT tool designed for ethical security research of AI conversational platforms. This tool helps security researchers identify potential data exposures in popular AI chat services through advanced search techniques and intelligent content analysis.

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**

This tool is developed for **educational and ethical security research purposes only**. Users must:
- ✅ Comply with all applicable laws and regulations
- ✅ Obtain proper authorization before testing
- ✅ Follow responsible disclosure practices
- ✅ Respect platform terms of service

- ❌ Never cause harm to systems or users

## 🔍 **Research Background**

Modern AI conversational platforms often generate shareable links for conversations, which may inadvertently expose sensitive information through search engine indexing. Our research focuses on identifying these exposures to help improve platform security.

### **Supported Platforms**
- Character.AI (beta.character.ai)
- ChatGPT (chatgpt.com)
- Claude (claude.ai)
- Perplexity (perplexity.ai)
- Poe (poe.com)
- Google Bard (bard.google.com)

## 📊 **Research Findings**

During our ethical security research conducted in August 2025, we identified several concerning patterns:

### **Case Study: Character.AI Exposure**

**Finding**: Public accessibility of private conversation data
- **Platform**: Character.AI (beta.character.ai)
- **Issue**: Chat conversations with sensitive data indexed by search engines
- **Risk Level**: HIGH ⚠️
- **Confidence**: 55% (Medium confidence based on AI indicators)

**Sample Discovery**:
```
URL: https://beta.character.ai/chat/post/?post=j5HA_MeyGtCRS2E-Eq6l_s__GJMdToYauFmQs0I_M6k
Type: API key exposure
Data Found: JSON structure with external IDs and potential tokens
Status: Reported through responsible disclosure
```

**Technical Details**:
- Exposed JSON structure containing conversation metadata
- Potential API key patterns detected
- Public accessibility without authentication
- Search engine indexing enabled

## 🛠️ **Tool Architecture**

### **Core Components**

1. **Precision Dorking Engine**
   - Service-specific search queries
   - Intelligent false positive filtering
   - Multi-engine search support

2. **AI Content Validator**
   - Platform-specific response pattern detection
   - Confidence scoring system
   - Sensitive data pattern recognition

3. **Smart Analysis Framework**
   - URL structure validation
   - Content authenticity verification
   - Risk assessment algorithms

## 🚀 **Installation & Usage**

### **Requirements**
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 sqlite3
```

### **Basic Usage**
```bash
# Full scan of all supported platforms
python piedpiper.py --all -d 5-10 -r 25

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Precision Dorking System**

```python
class PreciseAIServiceDorks:
    AI_SERVICES = {
        'chatgpt': {
            'domains': ['chatgpt.com', 'chat.openai.com'],
            'valid_paths': ['/share/', '/c/', '/g/'],
            'dorks': [
                'site:chatgpt.com/share intitle:"ChatGPT"',
                'site:chatgpt.com/share "API key" OR "secret key"',
                # ... additional precision dorks
            ]
        },
        'character_ai': {
            'domains': ['character.ai', 'beta.character.ai'],
            'valid_paths': ['/chat/', '/character/'],
            'dorks': [
                'site:character.ai/chat intitle:"Character.AI"',
                'site:character.ai "private conversation"',
                # ... character-specific dorks
            ]
        }
    }
```
